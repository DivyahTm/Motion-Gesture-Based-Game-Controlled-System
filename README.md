## Introduction

Traditional gaming systems often require the use of controllers or keyboards for user interaction, limiting the immersive experience. The Motion Controlled Game System aims to provide an alternative and engaging approach to gaming by utilizing computer vision techniques with OpenCV. By tracking hand gestures and movements, players can interact with the game in a natural and intuitive manner.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition.
- Support for multiple gestures and movements.
- Customizable gesture-to-action mapping for different games.
- Minimal hardware requirements, utilizing a standard webcam.

## Requirements

To run the Motion Controlled Game System, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
- Pygame (for game development)
- Webcam or any compatible camera device

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/motion-controlled-game-system.git
cd motion-controlled-game-system
```

## How It Works

The Motion Controlled Game System uses OpenCV for hand gesture recognition. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. Capture video frames from the webcam.
2. Preprocess the frames to enhance hand detection.
3. Apply contour detection to locate the hand region.
4. Extract hand features and recognize gestures using predefined rules or machine learning models.
5. Map recognized gestures to corresponding game actions.
6. Integrate the game control with Pygame or any game development library.

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the game system:

```bash
python MotionController.py
```

2. Position yourself in front of the camera and ensure your hand is visible.

3.Launch Any Car Based game where basic movemements will be controlled using Hand gesture 

4. Perform gestures and movements to control the game.
